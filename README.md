Finished three projects during this course:
1. [Hamming code Generator] (https://github.com/kalapathar/hardware_design/tree/master/hamproject1) 
2. [Software Simulation of the 1-bit ALU circuit](https://github.com/kalapathar/hardware_design/tree/master/pp-alu)
3. [Translation and Analysis in as88](https://github.com/kalapathar/hardware_design/tree/master/project3)
